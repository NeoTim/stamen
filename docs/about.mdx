Stamen is an An immutable React state management library.

If you're like me, tire of
provider, connections, actions, reducers, effects, dispatch, put, call, preload, @observable, @computed, @observer, @inject...

If you dont't like a lot of boilerplate, concepts, principles, APIs...

If you just want to get off work early.

You can try `stamen`.
